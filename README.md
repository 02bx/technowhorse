# TechNowHorse - Persistence Meterpreter Backdoor Generator

This small python script can do really awesome work.

## Following is the limitations of meterpreter payload generated using metasploit:-
  * Have to run the Metasploit Listener before executing backdoor
  * Backdoor itself don't become persistence, we have to use the post exploitation modules in order to make backdoor persistence. 
    And post exploitation modules can only be used after successful exploitation.
  * Didn't Notify us whenever payload get executed on new system.
  
We all know how powerful the Meterpeter payload is but still the payload made from it is not satisfactory.

## Following are the features of this payload generator which will give you a good idea of this python script:-
  * Uses Windows registry to become persistence in windows.
  * Also manages to become persistence in linux system.
  * Payload can run on LINUX as well as WINDOWS.
  * Provide Full Access, as metasploit listener could be used as well as supports custom listener (You can Create Your Own Listener)
  * Sends Email Notification, when ever payload runs on new system, with complete system info.
  * Generates payload within 1 minute of ever less.
  * Supports all meterpreter post exploitation modules.
  * payload Can be Created on Windows as well as Linux system.
