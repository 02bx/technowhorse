  TechNowHorse is a RAT (Remote Administrator Trojan) Generator for Windows/Linux systems written in Python 3.
</p>
              
                        This small python script can do really awesome work.

## Features
- [x] Works on Windows/Linux
- [x] Notify New Victim Via Email
- [x] Undetectable
- [x] Persistence
- [x] Sends Screenshot of Victim PC's Screen via email
- [x] Give Full Meterpreter Access to Attacker
- [x] Didn't ever require metesploit installed to create trojan
- [x] Creates Executable Binary With Zero Dependencies
- [x] Create less size ~ 5mb payload with advance functionality
- [x] Ofusticate the Payload before Generating it, hence Bypassing few more antivirus
- [x] Generated Payload is Encryted with base64, hence makes extremely difficult to reverse engineer the payload
- [x] Function to Kill Antivirus on Victim PC and tries to disable the security
- [x] Awesome Colourful Interface to generate payload
- [x] On Attacker Side: While Creating Payload, Script Automatically Detects Missing Dependencies & Installs Them

## Tested On
[![Kali)](https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=https://www.kali.org/)](https://www.kali.org) **Kali Linux - ROLLING EDITION**

[![Windows)](https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/) **Windows 8.1 - Pro**

## Following is the limitations of meterpreter payload generated using metasploit:-
  * Have to run the Metasploit Listener before executing backdoor
  * Backdoor itself don't become persistence, we have to use the post exploitation modules in order to make backdoor persistence. 
    And post exploitation modules can only be used after successful exploitation.
  * Didn't Notify us whenever payload get executed on new system.
  
We all know how powerful the Meterpeter payload is but still the payload made from it is not satisfactory.

## Following are the features of this payload generator which will give you a good idea of this python script:-
  * Uses Windows registry to become persistence in windows.
  * Also manages to become persistence in linux system.
  * Payload can run on LINUX as well as WINDOWS.
  * Provide Full Access, as metasploit listener could be used as well as supports custom listener (You can Create Your Own Listener)
  * Sends Email Notification, when ever payload runs on new system, with complete system info.
  * Generates payload within 1 minute or ever less.
  * Supports all meterpreter post exploitation modules.
  * Payload Can be Created on Windows as well as Linux system.

## Removing TechNowHorse in Windows:

#### Method 1:

   * Go to start, type regedit and run the first program, this will open the registry editor.
   * Navigate to the following path Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run There should be an entry called winexplorer, right click this entry and select Delete.
   * Go to your user path > AppData > Roaming, you’ll see a file named “explorer.exe”, this is the RAT, right click > Delete.
   * Restart the System.

#### Method 2:
   * Run "RemoveTechnowHorse.bat" in Infected System and then restart the PC to stop the current Running Evil File.



## Removing TechNowHorse in Linux:

   * Open Autostart file with any text editor,
     ****Autostart File Path: ~/.config/autostart/xinput.desktop****
   * Remove these 5 lines:
   
            [Desktop Entry]
            Type=Application
            X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
            Name=Xinput
            Exec="destination_file_name"
        
   * Note: **destination_file_name** is that name of evil_file which you gave 
      to your TrojanHorse using -o parameter
   * Reboot your system and then delete the evil file stored this this below path
   * Destination Path, where TrojanHorse is stored : **~/.config/xnput**
